#+TITLE: =These=: A Type for Inclusive Disjunction

A port and adaptation of C. McCann's and Oleg Grenrus' [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/these][Data.These]] Haskell
library.

=These.t= is a type for inclusive disjunctions. This code base includes two
libraries: the implementation of =These.t= and it's associated functions, and
the =Align= library, which uses =These.t= to enable zipping and unzipping
structures with mismatched shapes (e.g., lists of unequal length).

=These.t= can be leveraged anywhere you want to represent a value which can be
*this* thing of type ='a=, *that* thing of type *'b* or both of *these* things
given together.
